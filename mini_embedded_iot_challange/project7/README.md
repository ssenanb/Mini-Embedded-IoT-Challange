# Distance-Logger-with-Web-Interface

# Description

In this project, a real time sensor data monitoring system is designed using STM32 and ESP32 microcontrollers. The STM32 reads data from the HC-SR04 distance sensor data and the DS3231 RTC module. This data is formatted in JSON and sent to the ESP32 via UART. The ESP32 parses the received data and displays it through a local web interface over WÄ°-Fi. If the measured distance data is above a threshold, it is displayed on the web interface in real time. 

STM32 : It reads distance and time data, transforms it into the JSON format and sends it via UART.

ESP32 : It receive a the UART data from the STM32, parses it, sets up a web server and displays the data.

Web Server : A simple page created using HTML and JavaScript, which displays data by updating it every second.

Trigger : Only data above the threshold is displayed, prevent unnecessary data transmission.

This project provides an effective example of integrating embedded system with IoT technologies. It demonstrates how meaningful and filtered data can be wirelessly visualized using low power devices.
