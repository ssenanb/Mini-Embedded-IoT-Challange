# Mini-Embedded-IoT-Challenge

This repository was created to develop my skills in embedded systems and IoT, and it was published as a "Mini Embedded & IoT Challenge" series on LinkedIn. My aim was to improve from the basics to more advanced levels and to gain concrete knowledge, experience, and competence in each project.

# Goal

* A structural and practical introduction to embedded systems  
* Learning basic concepts such as RTOS, UART, ADC, PWM, communication protocols, and sensor reading  
* Transmission with IoT, JSON formatting, and cloud integration  
* Creating infrastructure for advanced-level fields such as RTOS, IoT, algorithms, communication, and sensor fusion  

# Technologies

* STM32F0DISC Microcontroller (HAL Library, CMSIS RTOS v2 API)  
* ESP32 WROOM 32D (via UART)  
* FreeRTOS  
* UART, I2C Bus, ADC, EXTI, GPIO  
* ThingSpeak, Adafruit IO, Bluetooth Terminal (IoT platforms)  
* C (STM32) & Arduino/C++ (ESP32)

# What I Learned

- Motor control with PWM signal and using PWM signal
  
- ADC reading and multichannel ADC reading  

- Interrupts  

- UART and I2C communication  

- Sensor fusion, filtering, and flag usage  

- JSON formatting and transmission via HTTP/MQTT/Bluetooth  

- Using IoT dashboards with ESP32  

- Communication between STM32 and ESP32  

- Semaphore, message queue, mutex, and RTOS task separation  

- Sensor reading and data utilization  

These are just a few of the many valuable things I’ve learned throughout this challenge — each project has added a new layer to my embedded systems knowledge and experience.
